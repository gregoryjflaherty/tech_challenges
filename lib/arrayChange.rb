# You are given an array of integers. 
# On each move you are allowed to increase exactly
#  one of its element by one. 
#  Find the minimal number of moves required to obtain a 
#  strictly increasing sequence from the input.

# Example

# For inputArray = [1, 1, 1], the output should be
# solution(inputArray) = 3.


# create empty counter called moves - set to zero
# goal is to have increasing array
# go through each cons 
# 
# begin loop - check if first is less than second
#  if less break loop and go to next iteratiuon  
#  if more add 1 to counter, keep on loop until first element is less than
#  return counter
